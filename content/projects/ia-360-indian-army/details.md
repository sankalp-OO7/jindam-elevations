Organ donation is a unique topic in the medical field which is both highly sophisticated, and simultaneously strongly affected by the complex socio-cultural-religious beliefs of the society. Adding to the complexity, the sensitive nature of the process means that the responsibility of a fair and efficient organ transplant process cannot be entrusted solely to any one private or government entity. In general, a nation cannot organize an effective organ transplant system without involving a number of entities from multiple domains to handle different aspects like donor-recipient matching and transplant auditing. A majority of these processes demand increased security in handling the data. This need for security, transplant tracking, and coordination of different organizations is one which can be fulfilled by using blockchain technology and Ayuadaan is a project realizing this vision.

Born out of a proof-of-concept competition by the Department of Information Technology, Government of Maharashtra to explore usage of blockchain technology in governmental services, Ayuadaan is an organ donation platform built on Quorum blockchain to facilitate the coordination between private hospitals and public health departments. Designed to be a modular organ donation solution, Ayuadaan currently simplifies hospital registration, transplant tracking, and specialist management use-cases. The application is currently operational in 80+ hospitals in Maharashtra involved in organ transplant and is in the process of adding and supporting additional use-cases for other medical institutes.
