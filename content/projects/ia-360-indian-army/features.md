<div style="border-left: 4px solid #333; padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
<strong>7. Blockchain-Generated QR Codes for Tracking.</strong> Unique, tamper-resistant QR codes link donor/recipient profiles, hospital records, and transplant documentation in a single identifier, making it easy to trace each organ through every step of the process.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #333; padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
<strong>8. Modular Specialist Management.</strong> Dedicated interfaces for surgeons, anesthesiologists, nephrologists, and nursing staff let each specialist update case progress, upload medical reports, and coordinate schedules seamlessly within a unified platform.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #333; padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
<strong>9. Transparent Transplant Tracking & Audit.</strong> The full chain of custody—from organ harvesting to final transplantation—is recorded on-chain, ensuring regulatory compliance, enabling real-time auditability, and facilitating post-operative reviews.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #333; padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
<strong>10. Inter-Institutional Coordination (Private/Public).</strong> Federated access controls enable private hospitals and government health departments to share transplant data securely while preserving patient confidentiality and reducing bureaucratic delays.
</div>

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #333; padding-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
<strong>11. Scalable Architecture (80+ Hospitals).</strong> Deployed across Maharashtra, the Quorum-based platform is designed to scale horizontally—supporting new use cases (e.g., specialist referrals or public health reporting) with minimal configuration and zero downtime.
